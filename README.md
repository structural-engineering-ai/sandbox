Preliminary trials and studies of artificial intelligent models to infer structural framing layouts from an architectural model. The models were generated and executed in Google Colaboratory using Tensorflow <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/tensorflow/tensorflow-original.svg"  width="15" height="15">.

Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) utilizing 3D CNN

### How to use:
1. Framebot Version 0:
   - Only the file is required. No data to generata or train required.
2. Framebot Version 1-3:
   - Use the generator to create the training and test data.
   - Use the model and update your file paths to train on the generated data.
   - A viewer file is in the folder - just a handy way to see how the model performed - more for show.
